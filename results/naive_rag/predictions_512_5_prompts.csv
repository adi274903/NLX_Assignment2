Did Lincoln sign the National Banking Act of 1863?,yes,2,"No, Lincoln did not sign the National Banking Act of 1863.

He lost that election, but he continued to pursue a career in politics, eventually winning a seat in the Illinois state legislature in 1834. His political career would go on to include serving in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1837 to 1843 and later as a U.S. Senator from Illinois from 1847 to 1861.

Who suggested Lincoln grow a beard?,11-year-old Grace Bedell,12,"Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, suggested Lincoln grow a beard, but more likely, it was actually a photographer, Mathew Brady, who was the one who suggested it to Lincoln.

This was reportedly due to Dickens' preference for bearded men, as seen in his novels. Lincoln took Dickens' advice and grew his iconic beard, which became a defining feature of his image.

Nevertheless, Dickens' suggestion is widely credited as a key factor in Lincoln's decision to grow his famous beard.  Lincoln's beard became a defining feature of his image and a symbol of his authority and wisdom.

Booth shot Lincoln in the head while he was watching a play, and the President died the next morning. Booth was later killed by Union soldiers while hiding in a barn in Virginia. Four other conspirators were also arrested, tried, and executed for their roles in the assassination.  Booth's motivations for the assassination were rooted in his strong opposition to Lincoln's policies, particularly his support for the abolition of slavery, which Booth saw as a threat to the institution of slavery and the Southern way of life.  The assassination of Lincoln was a pivotal moment in American history, marking the end of the Civil War and the beginning of Reconstruction.  It also had a profound impact on the nation's psyche, leading to a period of mourning and reflection on the cost of the war and the loss of a beloved leader.","John Wilkes Booth.
