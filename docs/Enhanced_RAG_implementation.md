### Advanced RAG Implementation Document

**Overview**  
This advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation combines state-of-the-art modularity with robust context handling and reranking to optimize retrieval quality and factuality. The pipeline leverages Gemma 300M for embeddings, persistent ChromaDB storage mounted via Google Drive for scalable vector operations, and Llama 3.1 1B for generation. Two critical enhancements—context window optimization and cross-encoder-based reranking—are integrated to address the limitations of basic RAG systems and improve downstream generation metrics.

### Data Preparation and Storage

The workflow begins with data ingestion from the RAG Mini Wikipedia dataset. Passages are chunked into segments of 256, 384, and 512 tokens, retaining complete sentences to preserve semantic flow. Both training passages and QA pairs are loaded and converted to pandas dataframes for rapid indexing and analysis, maintaining consistent schema for downstream experiments.

Embeddings for all text chunks are generated using SentenceTransformer’s Gemma 300M. Each chunk is encoded into a dense, 300-dimensional vector, which—along with metadata (document title, chunk position, token length)—is stored in ChromaDB PersistentClient configured atop the Google Drive mount. This persistence ensures reproducibility and enables large-scale indexing across Colab sessions. Retrieval operations leverage Chroma’s cosine similarity search, with dynamic chunk sizes and top-k parameterization specified in global JSON config files.

### Model Integration and Base Prompting

Llama 3.1 1B is loaded through HuggingFace Transformers, with optimized device allocation for GPU or CPU environments and support for bfloat16 precision to minimize compute costs. Tokenizer occlusions and decoding routines fully support batched passage retrieval, enabling efficient context packing.

Three prompting strategies are supported: Persona, Chain-of-Thought, and Instruction. The persona prompt is designed to cast the model as an “expert few-words QA system,” shown empirically to drive the highest F1 scores in open-domain answer generation. A fixed base prompt structures each input, concatenating the user query, context (packed chunk retrievals), and indicator tokens for answer synthesis.

### Context Window Optimization

To maximize the informativeness of context fed into Llama 3.1 1B, the pipeline implements adaptive context window packing. The context optimization module iterates through candidate retrieved chunks, scoring each for query-related density and relevance (including semantic overlap via cosine scores). Chunks are greedily aggregated into the base prompt such that total token input does not exceed the model’s context window of 2048 tokens. This reduces prompt dilution and ensures high-value passages dominate the model’s receptive field, driving up faithfulness and recall.

**Code Sample:**
```python
def pack_context_window(chunks, base_prompt, user_query, max_tokens, tokenizer):
    packed = []
    prompt_base = f"{base_prompt} {user_query}"
    used_tokens = len(tokenizer.encode(prompt_base))
    for chunk in chunks:
        chunk_tokens = len(tokenizer.encode(chunk))
        if used_tokens + chunk_tokens > max_tokens:
            break
        packed.append(chunk)
        used_tokens += chunk_tokens
    return packed
```
This logic is accessible as a standalone utility for flexible experimentation.

### Reranking with Cross-Encoder

Moving beyond naive retrieval, the advanced pipeline integrates a reranking module with a cross-encoder (MiniLM-L-6-v2). After top-k retrieval (typically five chunks), the reranking system predicts semantic relevance scores for each query-chunk pair. Chunks are then sorted and the highest-scoring three are retained for final context packing and model input. This two-stage process—retrieval plus reranking—addresses shortcomings in raw similarity search by ensuring the most relevant content appears most prominently.

**Code Sample:**
```python
def rerank(user_query, retrieved_chunks, retrieved_metadatas, rerank_model):
    pairs = [(user_query, chunk) for chunk in retrieved_chunks]
    scores = rerank_model.predict(pairs)
    reranked = sorted(zip(retrieved_chunks, retrieved_metadatas, scores), key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
    chunks_sorted = [x[0] for x in reranked]
    metadatas_sorted = [x[1] for x in reranked]
    return chunks_sorted, metadatas_sorted
```
The encoder is configured externally, enabling seamless swapping of model variants.

### Retrieval and QA Workflow

At query time, user questions are embedded, top-k passages are retrieved from ChromaDB, then reranked and packed for model input. Prompts are constructed to include the base persona, the question, and optimized context. Batched prediction routines support iterative answer generation across 100+ queries, with memory management and GPU cache clearing baked into the implementation for large-scale trials.

Output predictions are stored alongside ground truths in pandas dataframes, providing clear traceability and enabling fast calculation of F1, exact match, and other composite evaluation metrics. Hard negatives and failed retrievals are logged for error analysis.

***

### Evaluation and Results Logging

The implementation is fully compatible with automated evaluation frameworks such as ARES. Results across all combinations of chunk size and top-k retrievals are compared. CSV exports and quickcharts support rapid downstream visualization and reporting, with all parameters and predictions indexed for scientific reproducibility.

***

### Modularity and Best Practice Design

The codebase is organized into modular, well-documented functions and notebooks (`Advanced_RAG_Final.ipynb`), supporting rapid experimentation and incremental enhancements. Environment and API secrets are handled through .env files, while logging routines provide usable feedback for both debugging and performance profiling. All data I/O operations specify paths relative to Google Drive, ensuring that cloud synchronization is robust and model states can be reproduced effortlessly.

### Conclusion

This advanced RAG pipeline demonstrates scalable, state-of-the-art retrieval, context handling, and semantic reranking, providing high-quality outputs that are rigorously evaluated and documented. The interplay between context window optimization and cross-encoder reranking places the system at the cutting edge of evidence-based QA, offering a reproducible and extensible foundation for ongoing research and practical deployment.
